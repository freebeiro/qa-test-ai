# Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices to follow when developing the QA Testing Assistant extension. Following these guidelines will ensure code quality, maintainability, and testability.

## Code Organization

### Directory Structure

- **Keep related files together**: Files should be organized by feature or domain in their appropriate directories:
  - `src/background/`: Background scripts only
  - `src/commands/`: Command handling logic only
  - `src/content/`: Content scripts only
  - `src/ui/`: UI components only
  - `src/utils/`: Shared utilities only

- **Before creating a new file**:
  1. Read existing code to understand what's already implemented
  2. Check if the functionality already exists or can be extended
  3. Determine the most appropriate location for new code

### File Size and Complexity

- **Maximum file size**: Files should not exceed 150 lines of code
- **Function size**: Functions should be small and focused, ideally under 30 lines
- **Complexity**: Avoid deeply nested conditionals (max 3 levels)
- **When a file grows too large**:
  1. Split it into multiple files with clear responsibilities
  2. Create a new module if necessary
  3. Update the appropriate index.js file to export the new components

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle

- Each class/module should have only one reason to change
- Each file should focus on a single aspect of functionality
- Examples:
  - `navigation-handlers.js` handles only navigation commands
  - `input-handlers.js` handles only input commands

### Open/Closed Principle

- Code should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Use extension points like command handlers to add new functionality
- Example: Adding a new command should not require modifying existing command handlers

### Liskov Substitution Principle

- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Chrome API abstractions should be consistent with the original API
- Example: Our Chrome API wrapper should maintain the same interface as the original

### Interface Segregation Principle

- Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
- Create focused interfaces rather than general-purpose ones
- Example: Command handlers should only require the specific parameters they need

### Dependency Inversion Principle

- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Example: Background scripts should depend on the Chrome API abstraction, not directly on Chrome APIs

## Coding Standards

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions**: Use camelCase and descriptive names (e.g., `handleNavigationCommand`)
- **Files**: Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `navigation-handlers.js`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_HISTORY_LENGTH`)
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `QAInterface`)

### Comments and Documentation

- **JSDoc**: Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- **Inline comments**: Explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- **TODO comments**: Mark incomplete work with TODO comments
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Handles navigation commands
   * @param {Object} command - The command object
   * @param {number} tabId - The tab ID
   * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Result of the operation
   */
  ```

### Error Handling

- **Always catch exceptions**: Never let exceptions propagate unhandled
- **Provide meaningful error messages**: Error messages should be descriptive
- **Log errors**: Use console.error for debugging
- **Return standardized error objects**: Use formatError for consistent error handling

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- **Minimum coverage**: Aim for 80% code coverage
- **End-to-end testing**: Test complete user flows
- **Unit testing**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration testing**: Test interactions between components

### Test Organization

- **Test files**: Place test files in the `tests/` directory
- **Test naming**: Name test files to match the file they test (e.g., `navigation-handlers.test.js`)
- **Test structure**: Use describe/it blocks to organize tests

### Testable Code

- **Dependency injection**: Make dependencies injectable for easier mocking
- **Pure functions**: Prefer pure functions where possible
- **Avoid global state**: Use dependency injection instead of global state
- **Mock external dependencies**: Use mocks for Chrome APIs and other external dependencies

## Performance

### Resource Usage

- **Minimize memory usage**: Clean up resources when they're no longer needed
- **Avoid memory leaks**: Remove event listeners when components are destroyed
- **Optimize loops and data structures**: Use efficient algorithms and data structures

### Async Operations

- **Use async/await**: Prefer async/await over callbacks and promise chains
- **Handle promise rejections**: Always catch rejected promises
- **Avoid blocking the main thread**: Use async operations for long-running tasks

## Code Review Checklist

Before submitting code for review, ensure:

1. Code follows the directory structure and organization guidelines
2. Files are under 150 lines of code
3. Functions are small and focused
4. SOLID principles are followed
5. Code is well-documented with JSDoc comments
6. Error handling is robust
7. Tests are written and passing
8. Code coverage meets the 80% target
9. No duplicate functionality has been introduced
10. Performance considerations have been addressed

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly refactor code to improve quality
- Update documentation when making significant changes
- Share knowledge and best practices with the team
- Review and update these best practices as needed
